### Building üõ†

In order to start working on Chucker, you need to fork the project and open it in Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA.

Before committing we suggest you install the pre-commit hooks with the following command:

```
./gradlew installGitHook
```

This will make sure your code is validated against KtLint and Detekt before every commit.
The command will run automatically before the `clean` task, so you should have the pre-commit hook installed by then.

Before submitting a PR please run:

```
./gradlew build
```

This will build the library and will run all the verification tasks (ktlint, detekt, lint, unit tests) locally.
This will make sure your CI checks will pass.
